### Installation

#### Installing Ruby & Jekyll

If this is your first time using Jekyll, please follow the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and make sure your local environment (including Ruby) is setup correctly.

### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.
